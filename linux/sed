Sed

Linux 'sed' command stands for stream editor. It is used to edit streams (files) using regular expressions. But this editing is not permanent. It remains only in display, but in actual, file content remains the same.

-sIt is mostly used to replace the text in a file
-gTo replace all the occurrences of the string in the line.
-p Prints the replaced line twice on the terminal. If a line does not have the search pattern and is not replaced, then the /p prints that line only once.
-dIt is used for deleting lines from a particular file

Example1:It is mostly used to replace the text in a file
